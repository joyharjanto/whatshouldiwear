# whatshouldiwear
weather site that recommends whether you should wear cashmere or cotton. web app by flask, design by bootstrap. 
when you type a location be it country, city or home address, it will return a description of the current weather along with a recommendation.
this is my first iteration of the project :) 
using openweather API
